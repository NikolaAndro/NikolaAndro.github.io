Disjoint sets are the sets that have no element in common. If we were to perform an interception between two disjoint sets, we would get an empy set. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each element of a set is represented as an object and we wish to support the following functions of the objects:

- **Make-Set(x)** - This function creates a new set whose only member is x. Since this is the matter of disjoint sets, the element x must not exist in any other set.
- **Union(x,y)** - This function unites the dynamic sets that contain x and y, which results in a new set that is usion of the two united sets. Since the sets that contained
elements x and y originally are united into a single set and since we cannot have sets with the same elements, we must destroy the original sets where x and y came from and keep the freshly produced dataset.
- **Find-Set(x)** - This function returns a pointer to the set that contains the element x.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Problem 1:**

Suppose that \text{CONNECTED-COMPONENTS}CONNECTED-COMPONENTS is run on the undirected graph G = (V, E), where V = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k\} and the edges of E are 
processed in the order (d,i), (f,k), (g,i), (b,g), (a,h), (i,j), (d,k), (b,j), (d,f), (g,j), (a,e). 

**Solution:**
1. First, we create set with d,i edge --> make_set(d,i) = S1{d,i}
2. Repeat, S2 = {f,k}
3. Since (g,i) contains element i that is already an element of another existing set, we will perform union of htese 2 sets and remove the original set of i.

Existing sets:
- S2 = {f,k}
- S3 = {d,i,g}

4. (b,g)

Existing sets:
- S2 = {f,k}
- S4 = {d,i,g,b}

6. (a,h) 

Existing sets:
- S2 = {f,k}
- S4 = {d,i,g,b}
- S5 = {a,h}

8. (i,j)

Existing sets:
- S2 = {f,k}
- S5 = {a,h}
- S6 = {d,i,g,b,j}

10. (d,k)

Existing sets:
- S5 = {a,h}
- S7 = {d,i,g,b,j,f,k}

12. (b,j) since both elements are in the same set, this means that there is a cycle in the graph.

Existing sets:
- S5 = {a,h}
- S7 = {d,i,g,b,j,f,k}

14. (d,f) since both elements are in the same set, this means that there is a cycle in the graph.

Existing sets:
- S5 = {a,h}
- S7 = {d,i,g,b,j,f,k}

17. (g,j) since both elements are in the same set, this means that there is a cycle in the graph.

Existing sets:
- S5 = {a,h}
- S7 = {d,i,g,b,j,f,k}

19. (a,e)

Existing sets:
- S8 = {d,i,g,b,j,f,k,a,h,e}

# Linked Lists

Each set in this example can be represented using a linked list. Each member of the list contains the set member, the pointer to the next object in the list , and the pointer to the previous member in hte list.
The order of the objects in the list does not matter. 

In this case, Make_set(x) and Find_Set(x) require O(1) time. For Make_Set we just create a new linked list with the the only element x. For Find_Set(x) we just return the 
member variable in the object that we are pointing to. 

However, the Union(x,y) funuction would take  much longer O( $n^2$ ).
