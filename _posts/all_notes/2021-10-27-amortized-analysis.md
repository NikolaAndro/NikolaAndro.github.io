In the **amortized analysis**, we average the time required to perform a sequence of operations over the number of operations performed.

There are 3 different approaches to amortized analysis:

      1. Agregate Method - Determine total cost T(n) for a sequence of n operations and calculate the amortized cost per operation as T(n)/n.
      
      2. Accounting Method - Assign cost to each operation, overcharging some operations and undercharging some operations. The idea is that early overcharged operations 
      prepay for later undercharged operations. 
      
      3. Potential Method - A potential energy is associated to the data structure,rather than individual credit to operations.
