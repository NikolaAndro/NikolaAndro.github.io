 **Rod cutting** problem uses dynamic programming to solve a problem in deciding where to cut steel rods. 


# Problem:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Given a rod of length ***n*** inches and an array of prices ***p<sub>i</sub>***  for i = 1,2,...n that includes prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum revenue value ***r<sub>n</sub>*** obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if piece ***p<sub>n</sub>*** for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal   solution may equire no cutting at all.
