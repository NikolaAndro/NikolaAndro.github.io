 Invented by a matematician David Huffman.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Huffman Coding is a compression technique that is used to compress text files. We know that all what computer sees is a long stream of 1's and 0s. Hence, when we type text we get bunch of 0's and 1's. All these letters according to ASCII table have some value and each value is represented as 8 bits. That requires quiet a bit of memory. Hence, Huffman invented the first method for compressing this information. Today there are many compression techniques, but Huffman's was the first one. Today, we compress huge files to send them over email, etc.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If we have a string `BCCABBDDAECCBBAEDDCC`, we can see that it contains 20 characters. Each character consists of 8 bits => 20 x 8 = 160 bits total for this message.

# Fixed sized codes

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 We can see that we have 5 different values. We do not need all 8 bits to represent these 5 values. We can represent them with 3 bits.
 
  <div class="overflow-table" markdown="block">

| Character  |  count  | frequency  |  code  |   
| :----------|  :----  |  :-------  |  :---  | 
|     `A`    |   `3`   |   `3/20`   |  `000` |
|     `B`    |   `5`   |   `5/20`   |  `001` |
|     `C`    |   `6`   |   `6/20`   |  `010` |
|     `D`    |   `4`   |   `4/20`   |  `011` |
|     `E`    |   `2`   |   `2/20`   |  `100` |

</div>

 Each character from the string is represented with 3 bits. That means that total memory of the string is 20 x 3 = 60 bits, which is much better. Our string starts with BCC, so according to our table, it will be encoded as 001-010-010... 
 
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When we recieve this message, how is our computer going to know how to read this string now? Well, when we compress this text file, we compress the table together with it. That way, the reader will be able to decode the string. This table also requires some memory. The table contains 5 alphabets => 5 x 8bits = 40 bits. For each new code for letter we have 3 bits => 5 x 3 bits = 15bits. So, the size of our table is 40 + 15 = 55 bits.
 
 message + table = 60 + 55 = 115 bits
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is much less than our original message. This was done using *fixed-size codes*, but we can do even better with *variable-sized codes*.
