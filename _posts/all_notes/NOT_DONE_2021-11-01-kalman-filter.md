***The Kalman Filter*** is one of the most important and common estimation algorithms. The Kalman Filter produces estimates of 
hidden variables based on inaccurate and uncertain measurements. Also, the Kalman Filter provides a prediction of the future
system state based on past estimations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The filter is named after ***Rudolf E. Kálmán*** (May 19, 1930 – July 2, 2016). In 1960, Kálmán published his famous paper describing 
a **recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today the Kalman filter is used in Tracking Targets (Radar), location and navigation systems, control systems, computer graphics
and much more.
