During the 1990's data was usually collected in files that were in format of rows and columns. The amount of data was growing slowly, so a single storage unit and a processor would do the job of storing and processing the data.

However, today data is being shared over the internet in countless formats and in huge amounts. Handling this much data in so many different formats became difficult. This type of data is called **BIG DATA.**. At that point in time, **Hadoop** was invented to deal with this problem!

There are 3 components of Hadoop:

1. Storage Unit --> Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
2. Processing --> MapReduce
3. Resource Negotiator --> YARN

# HDFS

When storing the data, instead of storing the data on one computer (data node), Hadoop uses HDFS to split the data in **BLOCKS** and store them on different data nodes in the network.

In case one data node crashes, the data will not be lost becasue HDFS makes copies of the each block and saves them on different data nodes accross the network. This is called **Replication Method.**

# Mapreduce

In traditional processing of data, the data would be proccessed on a single machine with one processor or a few processors, which would not be efficient when it comes to big data. It would be costly (time).

To overcome this, **MapReduce** splits the data into parts and processes those parts on different data ndoes. The individual results are agregated to give the final output.


# YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

YARN is managing resources that are necessary to execute tasks from MapReduce. YARN consists of:

1. Resource manager
2. Node manager
3. Application Manager
4. Containers

When we want to execute the job we create in the MapReduce, the application master requests the container from the node manager. Once the node manager gets the resources, he/she sends those resources to the resource manager and the request is executed.


# Other Big Data Tools and Frameworks on Hadoop

1. Apache Hive
2. Apache Pig
3. Apache Spark
4. Apache Flume
5. Apache Scoop
6. Apache HBase (NoSQL database)
