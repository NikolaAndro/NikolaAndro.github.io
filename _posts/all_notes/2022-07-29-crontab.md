**Crontab** - Schedules commands execution at specified time or time interval.

# Difference between Cron, Crontab and Cron Job

|    Element   | Linux Name  |         Meaning         |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Deamon    | crond       | Pronounced “demon” or “day-mon”. These are Linux background system processes.        |
|    Table     | crontab     | You write rows to this table when entering a crontab command. Each ‘\*’ asterisk represents a segment of time and a corresponding column in each row.       |
|    Job       | Cron Job    | The specific task to be performed described in a row, paired with its designated time id |

# The Cron Table

Crontab stands for Cron Table. This is a Linux system file that creates a table-like structure where fields are separated by white space. Users can populate the table by assigning values to each field (asterisk).

# The Cron Job

If you’re not familiar with databases, you can imagine the cells in a blank Excel file. Either way, for this analogy each asterisk represents a column whose meaning is defined by its header. The final column will be a call for a command or script. Each complete row can be thought of as an individual job. These are often referred to as “cron jobs.”

# The Cron Daemon

We have already discussed the table and how we fill it with jobs. But, how do those jobs get executed? A system process called a Daemon runs in the background of our Linux machine.

There are Daemons for many different services. These are commonly named by suffixing a ‘d’ to a service name.

Naturally, the cron daemon is called ‘crond’. No action is required on our part to execute that daemon, but if you don’t think the command is working properly, you can use the ps command to verify that ‘crond’ is running.

        ps aux | grep crond
        
This command will search current processes for all users and return any instances of ‘crond’.


# Crontab syntax


        crontab [ -u user ] file
        crontab [ -u user ] { -l | -r | -e }
        crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }
        crontab [ -u user ] [ -l | -r | -e ] [-i] [-s]
        
General form: "run this command at this time on this date". Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var directory, they are not intended to be edited directly.

If a -u option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be tweaked.If this option is not given, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the command.

Note that su can confuse crontab and that if you are running inside of su you should always use the -u option for safety's sake.

## Cron Table Format

        *    *    *   *    *  Command_to_execute
        |    |    |    |   |       
        |    |    |    |    Day of the Week ( 0 - 6 ) ( Sunday = 0 )
        |    |    |    |
        |    |    |    Month ( 1 - 12 )
        |    |    |
        |    |    Day of Month ( 1 - 31 )
        |    |
        |    Hour ( 0 - 23 )
        |
        Min ( 0 - 59 )


- The asterisk (*) operator specifies all possible values for a field. e.g. every hour or every day.
- The comma (,) operator specifies a list of values, for example: "1,3,4,7,8".
- The dash (-) operator specifies a range of values, for example: "1-6", which is equivalent to "1,2,3,4,5,6".
- The slash (/) operator, can be used to skip a given number of values. For example, "*/3" in the hour time field is equivalent to "0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21"; "*" specifies 'every hour' but the "/3" means that only the first, fourth, seventh...and such values given by "*" are used.


# Crontab Options

To List Crontab entries, use -l option:

    $ crontab -l
    
To Install or update job in crontab, use -e option:

    $ crontab -e

After this command you will get something like:

      Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
      1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
      2. /usr/bin/code
      3. /bin/ed

      Choose 1-3 [1]: 1

To Deinstall job from crontab, use -r option:

    $ crontab -r
    
To Confirm Deinstall of job from crontab, use -i option:

    $ crontab -i -r
To add SELINUX security to crontab file, use -s option:

    $ crontab -s
To edit other user crontab, user -u option and specify username:

    $ crontab -u username -e
To List other user crontab entries:

    $ crontab -u username -l
