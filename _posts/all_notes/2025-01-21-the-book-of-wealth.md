Brian offers his mistakes as an opportunity to learn from them and not make the same mistakes.

## Mistake Chasing Money

Brian tried chasing after money in stock market - thinking that he can get rich off of making good trades. That turned into a second job that was not really investing, but speculating rather. He wasted a lot of time and energy since it did not pay off in the end.

This is what many financially literate people say. All you can do is make the average the market makes. Beating the market is done by 1% of financial gurus.

### Round #1 - Penny Stocks

Made a lot by pure luck. He thought he was smart until he lost all he made.

### Round #2 - Stock Options

When turned $10,000 into $60,000 using call options, Brian continued and due to a scandal in a company he invested in, he lost most of his money. No amount of research can prepare you for those rare events. 

### Round 3 - Crypto

Brian sold crypto when gains when 10x. However, crypte then went to 100x. Lesson is that it is nearly impossible to time the market. 


### Reflection

Speculating did not help Brian make real progress toward building wealth. It was mentally exhausting and very risky.

### The Pivot

Brian then focused on **`picking value stocks, diversifying, and aiming for steady growth`.** For a few years he even beat the market with 20% of increaso of his value. However, if your investments are low $40,000 in his case, that is only $8,000 per year. He would have been better off just finding a side job and making more money. <span style="color:yellow;">Therefore, the problem was `THE SCALE`</span>. 

Brian focused on increasing the income, so he could invest more and truly benefit from compounding.

This became his new focus.<span style="color:yellow;"> He stopped seeing investing as primary wealth-building strategy and started viewing it as a part of a bigger plan. The more he earned, the more he could invest. Only then investing returns would make a real difference. </span>

## How To Become an Expert

The key factors:

1. The effort you're willing to put in.
2. The time you dedicate to mastering your craft.

### Effort:

Make the most out of your time at work. Ask for new opportunities and try to gain more skills.

***<span style="color:yellow;">The effort you put in is entirely up to you - that drive must come from within.</span>***

That is why it is crucial to choose a field or job you enjoy or at least don't mind. When you're in an area that plays to your strengths, putting in the effort becomes easier. But if you are stuck in a job that makes you miserable, it will be hard to stay motivated.

### Time:

The more years of experience youo have in a certain field, the more opportunities you will have in that field and higher-profile assignments.

***<span style="color:yellow;">The time you spend in your field is an investment, and how you use that time determines your success. If you want to increase your income, becoming an expert is key. Expertise takes time and effort, so it's important to choose a field you can commit to for the long term. As your experience grows, so will your value, and that will be reflected in your earnings.</span>***

## Switching Careers

Switching careers too often will leave you with beeing a mediocre in all the fields you tried out while if you stick with the field you started with and become an expert, you will be compensated much more than if you stayed mediocre in some other field.

If you want to change your field, choose carefully and choose EARLY. Choose a field where top performers earn an income you;d be satisfied with and that you enjoy or at least don't mind.

## The Missing Link: Visibility And Income Growth

People need to know you exist and understand the value you bring. Without visibility, your expertise goes unnoticed and you miss out on hte financial rewards you deserve.

Practical steps to get noticed and show the value of your expertise:

1. Leverage online platforms and social media - show your skills online.
2. Network within your industry - attend conferences, webinars, or emetups to interact with peers
3. Ask for recommendations
