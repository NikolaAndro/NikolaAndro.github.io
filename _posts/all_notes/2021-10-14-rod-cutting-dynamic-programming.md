 **Rod cutting** problem uses dynamic programming to solve a problem in deciding where to cut steel rods. 


 # Problemm:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Given a rod of length `n` inches and an array of prices `p<sub>i` for i = 1,2,...n that includes prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum revenue value `r<sub>n` obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if piece p<sub>n for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal   solution may equire no cutting at all.
