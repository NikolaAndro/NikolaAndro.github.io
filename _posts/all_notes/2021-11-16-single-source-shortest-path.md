The **Shortest-paths problem** is represented as a weighted graph G = (V,E) with a weighted function w that represents metrics of the real world such as distance, time, cost
penalties, loss, etc... Hence, the shortest path between vertex **u** and vertex **v** is defined as any path **p** with minimum weight among all other paths.

The algorithm for the single source problem can solve variations of this problem such as:

- Single-destination shortest-paths problem:
- Single-pair shortest-path problem:
- All-pairs shortest-paths problem:
