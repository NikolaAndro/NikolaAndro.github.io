 **HBase** is a database management system that rests on top of the HDFS (Hadoop) and enables real time analysis of data. In other words, this is a Hadoop database. 
 
 It can store a huge amount of data in a tabular format for extremly fast reads and writes. 
 
 HBase is a type of NoSQL database and it is classified as a key-value store. Some characteristics are:
        
 - Value is identified with a key
 - Key and Value are ByteArray type
 - Values are stored in key-orders 
 
 Hbse is a database in which tables have no schema. At the time of table creation, column families are defined, not columns.
 
# NoSQL Database

 NoSQL is a form of unstructured data and it contains a wide variety of different types of data. On the other hand, RDBMS contains structured data that is heavily dependent on rows, columns, and tables. 
 
 
 Types of NoSQL:
 
      - Key Value database (containts a big hash table of keys and values - Oracle NoSQL,Scalaris)
      - Document-based database (stores documents made up of tagged elements - MongoDB, CouchDB, OrientDB, RavenDB)
      - Column-based database (each storage block contains data from only one column - BigTable, Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable)
      - Graph-based database (network database that uses nodes to represent and store data - Neo4j, Infinite Graph, FlockDB)

# HBase Architecture

 HBase contains 2 types of nodes - Master node and RegionServer nodes. There is only one master node running at the time, whereas there can be one or more region servers. The high availability is maintained by a service for distributed systems called Zookeeper. The master node manages cluster operations such as *assignment, load balancing, and splitting.* On the other side, there can be one or more RegionServers running at a time, while hosting tables, performing *read and writes* of data .
 
 A **Region** in HBase is *a subset of a table's rows.* The master node detects the status of RegionServers and assigns a region to it. 

# Storage Model of HBase

 The two major components of the storage model are:
 
 1. **Partitioning**
 
 - A table is horizontally partitioned into regions.
 - Each region is managed by RegionServer.
 - A RegionServer may hold multiple regions.

 2. **Persistance and data availability**

 - HBase stores its data in HDFS, does not replicate RegionServers and relies on HDFS replication for data availability.
 - Updates and reads are served from the in-memory cache called **MemStore**.

# Data Storage in HBase

 Data is stored in files called **HFiles or StoreFiles** that are usually saved in HDFS. Hfile is a key-value map generated due to MapReduce operations performed by Hadoop. When the data is added, it is writted to a log ccalled *Write Ahead Log* and stored in the memory, MemStore. HFiles are immutable (cannot be changed) since HDFS does not support updates on existing files.
